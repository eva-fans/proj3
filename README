This project is a simulator of e20 machine.
I create a machine with caches, then I open the e20 binary file to read, finally I load the machine code into memory.
After the machine start, the machine read a word from memory and parse the word as instruction.
If there is "sw" or "lw" instruction, I try to read firstly from cache L1, I will try to read from cache L2 if cache L1 does not hit, or I succeed reading the word.
I will read the word from memory and update the cache, if the word is not in caches.
When the cache detect the machine try to read from it, the cache log the behavoir into the machine.
Finnaly, I print the cache access log.
